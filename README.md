# Ikea_image_classifier

## Problem Definition: 
Scrape images from IKEA site(https://www.ikea.com/).

The dataset should be of at least 4 classes and should contain high level categories
and not subcategories, ie., it should be chairs vs tables instead of sitting chair vs bar
chair.

Perform the classification using machine learning technique(for eg. CNNs, RF). The model should be able to predict
the class label of an image.
